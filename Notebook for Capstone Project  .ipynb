Despite its worldwide fame, San Francisco is a relatively small city with a population of about 884,000. At roughly 7 miles x 7 miles, the city is largely walkable. While some characteristics of its 37 neighborhoods overlap, each is uniquely distinct and the presence or absence of basic services such as a public transportation stop, cafes, or grocery stores can have enormous impacts on the living experiences and sense of community among local residents.

With the exodus of local residents and shops, many neighborhoods are unrecognizable. The individualization of previously shared social experiences (transportation, shopping, etc) has further unraveled the social cohesion and percieved livibility of certain neighborhoods. Privatized, autoschediastic responses to underdeveloped infrastructure (Uber instead of an expansive metro system, grocery delivery apps instead of building grocery stores in neighborhoods with food deserts, a few mobile toilets instead of public bathrooms etc) make it increasingly difficult for people to connect with their neighbors."

They will collect data and analyze the geography and population of the neighborhood, the presence of existing grocery stores, locations that are absent of grocery stores, locations of weekly farmers markets, transporation location, and parks.
